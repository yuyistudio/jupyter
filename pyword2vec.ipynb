    "### 1. Continous Bag of Words Model \n",
    "\n",
    "The main data structures of CBOW (and for Skip_gram) are `syn0`, `syn1` and `syn1neg`. All of them can be viewed as feature reprs of the words in the vocab, but the words are combined in different specific ways. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "- `syn0` are the feature repr of words (also the leaf nodes in the Huffman tree) to be learned, and the words that are fired in `syn0` are a continuous sequence in a sentence (neighbors in semantic matter). \n",
    "- `syn1` are the feature repr of internal nodes in the Huffman tree. The words that are fired together are similiar to each other in the way that they are common parents of close words (in terms of similiar frequency) in the Huffman tree.  Parents of word nodes in Huffman tree are analogy to prototypes of clusters formed by words.\n",
    "- `syn1neg` are also feature repr of words in the vocab, but those words are selected via negative sampling. The words are sampled based on their frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to **learn** both `syn0` and `syn1`(and/or `syn1neg1). It might be helpful to understand the code in the following way. Again this is my personal understanding of the code, if it is wrong, it has nothing to do with the original project. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The cbow net can be thought of as a two-layer network. The nodes between two layers are **partially** connected. \n",
    "2. The first layer (input layer) are syn0 for both hs and negative-sampling.\n",
    "3. For hs, the second layer consists of the *parent* nodes in the Huffman tree. For a certain word w, there is a group of nodes in layer0 corresponding to the **neighbor words** around w in a sentence; and there is a group of nodes in layer1 corresponding to the **parent nodes** of w in Huffman tree. The connections only exist in the two groups in layer0 and layer1, and the weights of the connections are syn1, which is specific in each parent node in layer1. \n",
    "4. Similiarly for negative-sampling, but here the connections between nodes in layer0 and layer1 are actually *randomly sampled* - the nodes in layer1 are selected based on the power-law sampling given in Unigram Table. \n",
    "#### ================= Trained with HS ====================\n",
    "5. The computation happens in two directions. \n",
    "6. The forward computation first calculate `neu1` as the sum of the related nodes in layer0 (syn0 vectors). The output `f` is calcualted as the logistic transformation of inner product between `neu1` and `syn1`.\n",
    "7. Since the nodes that will be turned on in layer1 are parent nodes in Huffman tree, it is like training a multi-classification problem via the network. Here the pesudo targets for the output layer are the binary encoding of the corresponding parent nodes for the certain word. The reason behind this is that the parent nodes (and their encoding for a certain word) are a *sparse* and *deep* representation of the word - it is similiar to a hierarchical clustering with cluster prototypes as the parent nodes.\n",
    "8. So we have the output `f` and the psuedo target binary encoding of the word, we can calucate the cost function and thus gradient. By making the output and pseudo-target close to each other, we enforce that the feature represented as `syn0` (based on a word's context information in a sentence) can be used to approximate the distribution of the word in terms of the encoding by the Huffman tree. The gradient is calculated as `g` in the code (actually just part of it, the gradient is `g` multiplied by the input vector for a logistic regression training).\n",
    "9. Both `syn0` and `syn1` are updated according to the gradient, **interleavingly and iteratively**. That is, `syn1` are updated based on gradient, and all the connected `syn0` (neighbors in a sentence); and `syn0` are updated based on gradient, and all the connected `syn1` (parent nodes of the word in Huffman tree).\n",
    "#### ================= Trained with Negative Sampling ====================\n",
    "10. The forward calculation and backward updating are generally the same as in HS. \n",
    "11. The main differences are that the connected nodes in layer1 (represented by `syn1neg`) are from a sampling of the whole vocabulary, instead of from the Huffman tree.\n",
    "12. Accordingly, the pseduo target is are zero-one (similiar to sumvector of a traditioanl bag of words repr.). This essentially enforces that the `syn0` repr will be very close to itself and 'orthgonal' to other words - kind of like a autoencoder flavor. \n",
    "13. Compared to the encoding by Huffman tree, this 'bag-of-words' repr is not *deep*, and so it generally needs more instances in the training data."
